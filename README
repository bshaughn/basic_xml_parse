--comment from basic-xml-parse.js--
/*
   Welcome to the world's most basic "XML" parser, written in an afternoon.
   It doesn't look for comments, it assumes no extra whitespace, etc.
   All testing has been done on small inputs (<200 characters)

   In the interest of providing a timely solution, there is redundancy in this module.
   	  Refactoring can reduce file size, and complicate readability
      as well as maintenance, and may introduce corner cases. 

   This version includes:
     -basic bracket checking to make sure we have 
       correctly matching opening and closing bracket pairs.
     -tag checking to make sure opening and closing tags match.
     -nested dictionaries (keys can have values which are dictionaries)
